# Application Layers

Maps client request object to something the domain can understand. For example, the `controller` receives a `request command` and passes it on to the `application layer` which then maps or translates it to something like a `value object` or `domain entity` or something the domain can understand.

Application layer is close to the UI/client and know about client commands.

**Example application layers:**  `Ex1.ApplicationLayer.Web`, `Ex1.ApplicationLayer.Mobile`,  `Ex1.ApplicationLayer.Console`, `Ex1.ApplicationLayer.Forms`

The coordinate the execution of the entities, accpetance of input, and the delivery of output.

Application Layer (Interactor) recieves the `Request Model`, inspects the model, and controls the dance of the entities. Then build a `Result Model`, which is passed out through the output bundary, then delivery mechanism, and then displayed to the user.
