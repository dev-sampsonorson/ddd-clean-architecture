### Kinds of Business Rules

**Application Independent**

There are buisness rules that have nothing to do with the automation. These are the business rules that the system will still use even if they were no computers. For example, if building a banking system, interest calculations will be done whether or not there is a computer. 

`Entities` contain the application independent business rules.

**Application Specific**

There are other business rules that are all about the automation. Use cases are about the automation. The only reason these rules exists is because we are automating.
